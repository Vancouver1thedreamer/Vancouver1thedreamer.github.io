                                                  understand how competitors and users behave regarding how online transaction works.
                                                   I believe it’s important to get this information early on in the process, before having an idea or prototyping.
                                                   After analysing this insights, I began to conceptualize the solution, focusing on user flows and wireframe to give
                                                    me a way to iterate faster through ideas. From this, I went to the production mode, designing
                                                     the interface considering design principles such as contrast, hierarchy and feedback; 
                                                   brand attributes; user interactions, and the imagistic universe presented as briefing by the case.
                                                 Once the interface was ready, I took feedback from two other fellow developer and designer in order to understand the experience gaps. 
                                                 functionality, although part of my usual design process, would be a post-conceptualization and interface step and won’t be discussed in depth in this case.

                                                   place due to the pandemic but with all that, I did not see that much as a Challenge. In the first week of the research, The interview sample took into account men and women aged from 18 to 46, I facetimed a total of 5 friends
                                                   asking them how well they use mobile e-wallet and 4 of the 5 used. Also I took advantage of whatsapp status, with that I wrote on my status asking people on my contact list 
                                                   if they used mobile digital wallet and how'd love if they shared their experiences with me, I got a total of 19 whatapp dm of people sharing their experience. Ofcourse some had good things to say and others not so much.
                                                   I also went ahead to ask them,
                                                   <br>

                                                    <li style="text-align: left;"> I also enquired to ask what are the thing they think would improve their experience and I got quite a lot of responses.</li>
                                                   Finally in total, It took me 4 days to conclude the research with experience users 
                                                   Also, I was quite lucky to have a one on one zoom call with a developer from one of the popular e-wallet companies in Nigeria.

                                                  as it build a solid foundation for we designer to under the challenges and goals that concerns the users. Without key research, the challenges
                                                  can not be solved.
                                                  During the research process, with the user data I already gathered, I first gathered information about how frequent 
                                                  people in lagos (the city i reside in), and one intresting thing is this, the use of e-wallet application are quite rampate,
                                                  especially in places where banking system is less developed. According to my research, there is a high level of comfort in using
                                                  digital wallet, simply because people will grasp on to any system that works for cashless transaction. <br>

                                                  However, during the pandemic, the use of digital wallet application increased profoundly, local business owner moved from handling physical cash too cashless transactions
                                                  which they found very lucrative and comfortable to use. Also during the pandemic, the banking system services are extremely poor, banking halls 
                                                  where packed with people, 
                                                   trying to make money transaction and most of them weren't even able to achieve their goals, it was a rather frustrating Expercience
                                                    with all that a lot of covid-19 rules were flunked, also banks closed much earlier, most time they didn't open at all.
                                                    And all that made the use of e-wallet more popular. <br>

                                                   Alot of times, people who use digital wallet, do not keep track of how much they send daily, with Duopay, I wanted users to gain access and giving
                                                    them an insight of their financial activities, which a lot of this competitors in the market don't show their user. <br>

                                                    I took my time to look at the market insight as well market competitions, to learn what maked their business thrive and as well as 
                                                    the challenges they faced, and with user research, I was able to acquire and understand the user experience that they present to their users

                        <p style="text-align: left; font-size:20px;">With Duopay app, users are greeted with the onboarding screen, with this, it acts as a walkthrough
                             for the users to get firsthand some features that are available to them,
                            it’s important that users understand the value proposition quickly.</p>

                        <p style="text-align: left; font-size:20px;">I chose to do this through an automatic slider. Almost effortless for users see all content. The primary “get started” button is
                             always visible on the screen, so the onboard 
                            assigns an overview of the functionality, but it doesn’t prevent them from continuing through the flow, user can choose to skip.
                           Also, the onboard would appear only the first time a user went through the flow. From the moment the user opts-in, this 
                          functionality is presented.</p>

                        <p style="text-align: left; font-size:20px;">Duopay makes it easy to pay without sharing your financial information. I use multiple factor authentication
                            layers of security to protect your payment information and privacy Convenient</p>

                        <p style="text-align: left; font-size:20px;">Security is very one important phase of using e-wallet application, with security the users will feel much safer about their financial details and
                            this builds confidence and trust for the user. Now in Duopay users are required to type in their mobile phone number, their a unique pin code they themselves create during the sign up process
                            and for final login, they are required to user their fingerprint. For first time users, they get to sign up before accessing app.
                            I wanted to make the login method security thight but not too long and dreadful to access for the users, so as to not get tedious or frustrating.

                         <p style="text-align: left; font-size:20px;">This screens is responsible for giving users a place to see their cards applied on the wallet. I created a feature where user can apply up to 4 cards, and 
                            created a virtual credit card of different style, that way they can differnciate one card from the other, they can swipe
                            to view any of the cards, users can automatically click on any of the cards to view details.

                         <p style="text-align: left; font-size:20px;">Also, still on the screens, users can see their spendings of the day used on any of the card and as well see spending history of 2 days before.
                            I wanted to make the home screen clean and minialistic and easy to understand at first glance.
                            A floating button is also provided for users to more cards. once a user clicks the button it automatically navigates them to the add a new card screen.

                            Through out this project, it was largely based on user concerns, giving them control, I wanted the user to see everything that goes on
                            their card. When a user click any of their virtual cards, they are immediately taken to these screens.

                         <p style="text-align: left; font-size:20px;">On these screens,the users are giving tons of choices from <strong>"Lock card":</strong> which allows them to lock the card 
                            to avoid any purchase, and this can be achieved when the user use the toggle button.<strong> "Pay":</strong> this button gives a user
                            access to pay for their purchases directly from the card.<strong>"Transfer":</strong> this automatically takes the users to where they can perform transfers to others.<br>
                            However, the user also get to see previous purchases on the card, as well as history details when they click on the history button, they are automatically 
                            moved to see the "history chart board", users can choose to swipe up to see their month of spending history

                            With Doupay they can access the Pay via SQ code feature. It's not only easy and reliable but also very reconginzable for users to use. The pay via SQ code payment method is very comfortable to use and 
                            users might also be very familar to it, that's makes it seamless. Here I wanted to implement a feature that encourages cashless money transaction. 
                            However, These days a lot of businesses and business owners prefer this payment method, it lessens the hussel for them having to deal with physical cash and having to take a drip to the bank to deposit their money.
                            The Pay via SQ code payment method, doesn't just benefit people who intent to purchase but also offer goods and services(business owners).
