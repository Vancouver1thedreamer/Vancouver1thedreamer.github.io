                                   The first step of the design process involved user interviews and Key research to understand how user/customer behave, their goals 
                                   and challenges using smiliar product as Yayride and, how competitors. I believe itâ€™s important to get this
                                    information early on in the process, before having an idea or prototyping.
                                    After analysing the insights and research data, I began to conceptualize the solution, focusing on user flows and wireframe to give me a way to iterate faster through ideas.
                                    From this, I went to the production mode, designing the interface considering design principles such as contrast, hierarchy and feedback; brand attributes; user interactions,
                                     and the imagistic universe presented as briefing by the case.

                                    One the interface is fully ready for testing, I seek the options and remarks from other 2 designers and a developer
                                    before I release it out for the user testing stage

                                    During the user research process, I take alot of things into account such as user behaviour and pain points.
                                    I make use of Surveys and interviews to gather data as it aids me to curate my approach to solving the project

                                User research are a core user experience method, That would bring enough data and inputs to generate concepts and hypothesis.

                                A survey was conducted with frequent yayaride or similar product users with the use of google form. The questions were based on habits, motivation, and challenges while using a ride-hailing applications, 
                                The responses were collected in the form of multiple choice and short answers to get more insights at an early stage.

                            who are frequent users of ride-hailing services of the city of Lagos, Nigeria, with different mobility habits.
                            The interview took approximately 10-15 minutes and included topics to get to the core of what users are trying to do and what their problems are. So I asked:

                                After analysing the interviews, despite the amount of generated data, this was the most relevant information for decision-making in creating the solution.
                                After getting insights from user research I had a clear understanding of who my target user will be and created a 
                                persona. By gathering data and talking to a lot of ride-hailing users who have lived the experience I
                                 were able to come up with four personas that represent
                                 the gradient of behaviour of this users worldwide. These are the highlights for each persona:<br>

                                    More usability testing, Research, and Analytics would uncover additional pain points and would lead us to make better design decisions. One takeaway from working on this project was understanding the value of user research and planning to synthesize
